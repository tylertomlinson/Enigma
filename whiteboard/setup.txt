Enigma setup

  build out encrypt and decrypt to pass in arguments and hash to build from







Shifter

  Initializes with alphabet:
      ("a".."z").to_a << " "


***  Will need to shift the keys and date offset then will take the the
***   keys with the date offset and merge together

***    It is the sum of key + offset
***        A key + B key



Need to rotate now
  encrypt will shift forward - working on
  decrypt will shift backward - working on

  Translate using lowercase letters.
