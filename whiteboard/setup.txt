Enigma setup

  build out encrypt and decrypt to pass in arguments and hash to build from







Shifter

  Initializes with alphabet:
      ("a".."z").to_a << " "


***  Will need to shift the keys and date offset then will take the the
***   keys with the date offset and merge together

***    It is the sum of key + offset
***        A key + B key



Need to have message arg for encrypt now work with shifter
  encrypt will shift forward
  translate using lowercase letters. So everything will be down cased

  "hello" will be shifted as A - h
                             B - e
                             C - l
                             D - l
                Loops back   A - o


    




decrypt will shift backward - working on

Translate using lowercase letters.
